                <p>"<b>The home of golf</b>." You thought of St. Andrews no doubt.
                For the players of the Putt and Pint Pro Tour, the above statement can mean only one place.</p>
                <br>
                <p>C Town has been the proving grounds to all of the competitors on the Putt and Pint tour through the years. It 
                  has not only served as an Academy for player development but has been a consistent “go-to” course 
                  throughout the season featuring multiple major championships and countless tour events. </p>
                <br>
                <p>A testament to the importance of this course is obvious in the numerous members who call it their 
                  home club. There are only 2 players on the tour who have memberships elsewhere. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Craddockstown is Christmas Dinner with your family, it is your mum giving you updates on your relatives 
                  you haven’t seen in years, it's a good pint of Guinness in Haydens, Craddockstown is always there for you, it is 
                  always dependable. Craddockstown is home.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This all sounds very romantic, doesn't it? Truthfully it was.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A major won by Mr.Sean Whitson (in spectacular and dominant fashion might I add). 
                  It represented far more than a game of golf for these men. 
                  In the midst of a despairing and prolonged golf drought, brought about by a global phenomenon 
                  I hope we never see the likes of again. 
                  294 days had passed - to be exact. Swings were rusty. Golf shoes had decayed and come apart. 
                  Cobwebs were stringing themselves on lonely, unused clubs. Golf gloves hardening and beginning to grow mold…….
                  The players were themselves despairing - it had been a long time away from home. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The 2021 Craddockstown Major represented more than a competition for these men, it was an emphatic statement.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Putt and Pint Tour is eternal and Craddockstown Golf Club, Naas, Co.Kildare, is home.</p>

              <p>In comparison to other professional golf tours, the culture within the Putt and Pint is quite unique. 
                On other tours, players might be overheard offering advice and encouragement to one another. It may 
                then come as a surprise to some of the newer members of our fanbase who are more likely to hear cries 
                of laughter and glee at a high sliced drive or a dodgy putt. 
                Players reveling in the demise of their competitors is not surprising given the stakes these men play 
                for; glory, immortality, a major championship.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, when the cameras stop rolling and the press are off brainstorming their next clever tabloid 
                  headline, a very different culture emerges. One of camaraderie, of compassion, a culture of friendship 
                  in its truest and most vulnerable form. </p>
                <br>
                <p>What we see in the above image is one of the tour greats - a genuine low handicap golfer that consistently 
                  has improved over the years, adding nuance and verve to his well known grip it and rip it swing that has 
                  made his name. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Rookies Gearoid Comber, Eoin Messit, Dave McGrath and Phil Mahon huddle around for a swing lesson from 
                  Mr.Whitson. This embodies the unseen side of the Putt and Pint Tour. 
                On the course these men are gladiators battling it out for that win, taking no prisoners, not giving their 
                competitors an inch and seeking out every advantage they can in order to win the prize of prizes, that 
                title of reigning major champion.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This is perhaps competition at its truest form - the elite aiming to improve the novice. These men want 
                  to win, but more important than that, they want to beat you when you are at your best. They want to know 
                  that you showed up with your "A" game, and still it was not enough to win. This is how warriors stay sharp - 
                  with an honest trial of skill, of tenacity and of mental strength. 
                A battle on even ground.</p>
