                <p><b>The home of golf.</b> You thought of St.Andrews no doubt.
                For the players of the Putt and Pint Pro Tour, the above statement means only one place.</p>
                <br>
                <p>C Town has been the proving grounds to all of the competitors on the Putt and Pint tour, it has not only served as an Academy for player development but has been a constant “go-to” course throughout the season featuring multiple major championships and countless tour events. </p>
                <br>
                <p>A testament to the importance of this course is obvious in the numerous members who call it their home club. There are only 2 players on the tour who have memberships elsewhere. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Craddockstown is Christmas Dinner with your family, it is your mum giving you updates on your relatives you haven’t seen in years, its a good pint of Guinness in Haydens, Craddockstown is always there for you, it is always dependable. Craddockstown is home.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This all sounds very romantic, doesn't it? Truthfully it was.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A major won by Mr.Sean Whitson (in spectacular and dominant fashion might I add). It represented far more than a game of golf for these men. In the midst of a despairing and prolonged golf drought, brought about by a global phenomenon I hope we never see the likes of again. Many, many months had passed. Swings were rusty. Golf shoes had decayed and come apart. Cobwebs stringing themselves on lonely, unused clubs. Golf gloves growing mould…….
                The players were despairing, it had been a long time away from home. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The 2021 Craddockstown Major represented more than a competition for these men, it was an emphatic statement.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Putt and Pint Tour is eternal and Craddockstown Golf Club, Naas, Co.Kildare, is home.</p>

              <p>In comparison to other professional golf tours, the culture within the Putt and Pint is quite unique. 
                Players often can be overheard offering advice and encouragement to one another, perhaps this may come as a surprise to some of the fans who have attended our events where it is more likely to hear cries of laughter and glee at a high sliced drive or a dodgy putt. 
                Players reveling in the demise of their competitors is not surprising given the stakes these men play for, glory, immortality, a major championship.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When the cameras go away and the press are off brainstorming their next clever tabloid headlines, a very different culture emerges, one of camaraderie, of compassion, a culture of friendship in its truest and most vulnerable form. </p>
                <br>
                <p>What we see in the above image, is one of the tour greats, a genuine low handicap golfer that consistently has improved over the years, adding nuance and verve to his well known grip it and rip it swing that has made his name. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Rookies Gearoid Comber, Eoin Messit, Dave McGrath and Phil Mahon huddle around for a swing lesson from Mr.Witson. This embodies the unseen side of the Putt and Pint Tour. 
                On the course these men are gladiators battling it out for that win, taking no prisoners, not giving their competitors an inch and seeking out every advantage they can in order to win the prize of prizes, that title of reigning major champion.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This is perhaps competition at its truest form, the elite aiming to improve the novice. These men want to win, but more important than that; they want to beat you when you are at your best, they want to know that you showed up with your A game, and still it was not enough to win, an honest, true warriors trial of skill, of tenacity, of mental strength. 
                A battle on even ground.</p>
